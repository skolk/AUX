# This will include some basic unit testing on python code stuffs
# We will need to build:
# A fixutre to bring up a testing meteor server
# A fixture to start up a testing storage chain
# A fixture to start up the kesm (real and fake)

# Super Basic Tests
# Import the KESM library w/o failure
# "        " storage "           "

# Start meteor, make sure it runs for 20+ seconds, kill it


# Import the camera library
#  - Set some random properties on and off and inside valid ranges
#  - turn the camera on and off

# Import the serialCamera library
#  - Get and set the various modes
#  - Measure the tempertature

# Import the stage library.
# Confirm that stages are homed and have 1cm clear in each direction before proceeding
# Move each axis (check Position):
#  - Linear 0.5 cm forward
#  - Linear 0.5 cm backward
#  - abs 0.5 forward
#  - abs 0.5 backward
#  - lineartly together all three axes

# Import the storage chain
#  - Instanciate each of the classes
#  - Run Each
